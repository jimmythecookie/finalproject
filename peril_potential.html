            <h2>Risks of AI in Education</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bias and Inequality:</strong> Sometimes, AI systems can unfairly treat some students differently from others if they learn from biased data.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Issues:</strong> Using AI in schools can lead to concerns about how much personal information is collected and kept private.</li>
                <li><strong>Too Much Tech Dependence:</strong> Relying heavily on AI can make students less skilled in thinking critically and solving problems on their own.</li>
                <li><strong>Unequal Access:</strong> AI technology might only be available to students in wealthy schools, making the gap bigger between rich and poor students.</li>
